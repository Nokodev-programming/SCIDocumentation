![DLM Image](/img/DLM.png)

DLM API Extension is a mod/add-on for Scrap Mechanic which extends the game's Lua Modding API.

It does so mainly by adding various Lua libraries and functions to the API that would otherwise not be available. <br></br>
Some of those are *existing* libraries (such as [HTTPS](/modapis/DLM/Static-Functions/dlm.http)) with a wrapper written around them, while others (like [Audio](/modapis/DLM/Static-Functions/dlm.audio)) <br></br>
are *completely custom-made* specifically for this mod.

Apart from this, DLM also applies some other, minor improvements (see [Other Changes](/modapis/DLM/other_changes)).

Also note that DLM does NOT affect multiplayer - you can play without any issues even with this mod installed.

### Download DLM

You can download the newest DLM version [here](/files/DLM_API_Extension_2_3.zip).

Older versions of DLM can be found [below](#old-versions).

**DLM API Documentation** can be found in the categories on the left and <br></br>
as a [Lua documentation file](/files/DLM.lua) (written by Tofix.rs).

### How to install and use

:::caution warning
There are some important things you need to be aware of before installing this mod. <br></br> <br></br>

<strong>The download link provided below is THE ONLY official source of this mod!</strong> <br></br>

If you download it from **anywhere else**, it might contain a virus, malware, etc. <br></br>

**If you are a mod developer using this mod, do NOT re-distribute this mod's files in your own mod(s)!** <br></br>
**Instead, add a link to this page and let people download it from here themselves.** <br></br> <br></br>

**The added HTTP library allows mods to send/request data to/from any server on the internet.** <br></br>
While this is a useful feature, it also means that such a mod may connect to potentially unwanted <br></br>
services and send or receive data (like player usernames). <br></br> <br></br>

**If you find a bug or malfunction in this mod** <br></br>
**There are 4 (four!) ways to report issues** with any of my content, [which you can see here](https://scrapmechanictools.com/report_issues.html). <br></br>
If you find a bug in this mod, *please use one of these ways* to *report said bug*. <br></br>
Please do *not* spread claims like "the mod breaks things", ***especially*** if you have <br></br>
not reported said bug using one of the 4 ways above! <br></br> <br></br>

**I (the creator of DLM) am NOT responsible for any damages caused by this library or any mods <br></br>
using it, *especially* if you downloaded this mod from any place other than this website.**

:::info note
In order to use DLM together with the [SMInjector](https://github.com/TechnologicNick/SMInjector), you need to follow special installation instructions (see [Using DLM With SMInjector](/modapis/DLM/SMInjector_install)).
:::

First, download DLM from [the link above](/files/DLM_API_Extension_2_2.zip).

To install it, simply un-zip the zip file into any folder, then open the extracted <code>DLM API Extension</code> folder and run the provided <code>install.exe</code>. <br></br>
If the installer fails or you do not want to run it, you can also manually copy the files in the <code>DLM API Extension/files/</code> folder, <br></br>
open your Scrap Mechanic installation folder, paste the copied files into <code>Scrap Mechanic/Release/</code> <br></br>
and select <code>Replace existing files</code> if required.

To <strong>remove DLM</strong>, either use the provided <code>uninstall.exe</code> or [verify your game files](steam://validate/387990).

After installing, you can use the API functions listed in the categories on the left.

:::info note
As of DLM version 2.1, the extension does not work with the custom game test button in the Mod Tool. <br></br>
**This will be fixed in version 3.0.** <br></br> <br></br>

The DLM installer may not work properly if Scrap Mechanic is not installed in the default directory (C:/Program Files(x86)/...). <br></br>
**This will be fixed soon.**
